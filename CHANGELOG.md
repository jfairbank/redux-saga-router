## v2.2.0

## NEW - Array Routes

Credit to [@paulcoyle](https://github.com/paulcoyle).

Sometimes you want some routes to take precedence over others. For example,
consider a `/users/invite` route and a `/users/:id` route. JavaScript objects
don't guarantee order, so the `/users/:id` route could take precedence and match
`/users/invite`. So, the `newUser` handler would never run.

## Miscellaneous Changes

* Support redux-saga 0.16 in `peerDependencies`.
* Update README to show React Router v4 support. (credit [@visusnet ](https://github.com/visusnet))

```js
// Can't guarantee precedence with an object
const routes = {
  '/users/invite': inviteUser,
  '/users/:id': newUser,
};
```

To fix this problem, you can define routes with an array of route objects like
so.

```js
const routes = [
  { pattern: '/users/invite', handler: inviteUser },
  { pattern: '/users/:id', handler: newUser },
];
```

The array form will register routes in the order you provide, ensuring
precedence.

## v2.1.2

### Bug Fixes

* Prevent missing `PropTypes` with `createLink` when using React 16. Attempt to import `PropTypes` from the `prop-types` package if `PropTypes` is missing from the `React` object.

---

## v2.1.1

### Internal fixes

* Replace `[...effects]` with `all` per redux-saga 0.15's deprecation notice

## v2.1.0

### NEW

Redux Saga Router now supports a third optional options argument.

#### Available Options

Key                 | Description
--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------
`matchAll`          | If set to `true`, it allows all matching routes to run instead of the first matching route.
`beforeRouteChange` | Set to a saga to run any time location changes. This is useful for dispatching a cleanup action before route changes.

```js
const options = {
  matchAll: true,

  *beforeRouteChange() {
    yield put(clearNotifications());
  },
};

function* mainSaga() {
  yield fork(router, history, routes, options);
}
```

Thanks to [@TeoTN](https://github.com/TeoTN) for implementing these two options!

## v2.0.0

### Spawned Route Sagas

While this is a new major version, there aren't any directly noticeable breaking
changes. Route sagas used to be invoked via the `call` effect. Unfortunately,
`call` is blocking, so long running sagas could prevent other route sagas from
immediately running if the route changed. Another issue is that if a route saga
happened to `fork` or `spawn` a sub saga, there was no way to know when the
route changed to perform cleanup such as cancelling the forked sub saga.

Thanks to [@victorchabbert](https://github.com/victorchabbert), route sagas are
now spawned via the `spawn` effect. This creates a detached, forked task for
each route saga when its route triggers. Now, when the route changes, Redux Saga
Router will cancel any currently running route saga task, giving you the
opportunity to perform cleanup in your route saga or sub sagas.

```js
const delay = time => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time));

function* autoSaveSaga() {
  try {
    while (true) {
      const data = yield select(getData);
      yield call(Api.saveEditor, data);
      yield call(delay, 5000);
    }
  } finally {
    if (yield cancelled()) {
      // do some other cleanup
    }
  }
}

const routes = {
  '/editor': function* editorSaga() {
    try {
      yield fork(autoSaveSaga);
    } finally {
      if (yield cancelled()) {
        // do some cleanup
      }
    }
  },
};

function* mainSaga() {
  yield* router(history, routes);
}
```

Because the behavior of route sagas has slightly changed, this could impact your
application. For example, if you have a route saga that fetches some data from
an API and the route suddenly changes, Redux Saga Router used to wait for the
data to come back and the currently running saga to complete before starting the
new route saga. Now, Redux Saga Router will cancel the running saga even if the
data hasn't come back yet. This new behavior actually makes more sense because
there is no reason to complete fetching the data or delay letting the new route
saga run. If you used to depend on the previous behavior, though, then Redux
Saga Router could break your app. Therefore, this release was a major bump so
you can ensure your route sagas are safe before upgrading.
